<h4>1. Parañaque, Manila, Luzon (4/5)</h4>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>           Megacity, Capital<br>
<strong>Date:</strong>           16.12. - 17.12.14<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Manila does not have a good reputation, but more than any other metropolis in Southeast Asia it is an exciting melting pot of colonial heritage, business city, shopping malls, slum, Chinatown, American fast food restaurants, seafront, 24/7 nightlife and traffic jam.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> As most travelers will pass by Manila anyway it is worth staying here two to three days to explore the city. We decided to visit Manila at the end of our trip. To get around fast avoid the rush hour from 7 - 9 a.m. and 17 - 20 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodation:</strong>  <em><a href="http://www.domesticguesthouse.com" target="_blank" rel="external">DG Budget Hotel Naia</a></em> (3/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Hostel<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 25 € per night for AC room with double bed and shared bath<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> We chose this accomodation as it is very close to the Airport as we had another flight the next day;</p>
<p><strong>Shopping:</strong> <em><a href="http://www.dfp.com.ph/node/478" target="_blank" rel="external">Duty Free Philippines Fiestamall</a></em> (2/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Shopping Mall<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Next door is a Duty Free Mall, where you find literally all kind of western goods, but you will have to struggle your way out again. It might be a nice alternative to the small and pricy airport duty frees, but some articles like alcohol are definately way more expensive then in Europe or even local supermarkets. The only plus is the quite nice food court in there.<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> Unfortunately we couldn’t bring our guns…</p>

<p><font color="red"><strong>1. Transportation:</strong>   Taxi to Manila Airport (1/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Taxi<br>
<strong>Distance:</strong> 5 km<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong>  5 €<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Before we could take off we got stuck in the worst traffic jam ever. We would have been faster by walking actually. There are crazy traffic conditions around the airport, especially to Terminal 3, where you can get only by taxi. Plan 1 - 2 hours additionally to get there in time!<br>
<font color="black"></font></font></p>

<strong>Distance:</strong> 300 km<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour<br>
<strong>Costs:</strong> 60 € + 4 € Terminal Fee<br>

<p><strong>Type:</strong>           Town<br>
<strong>Date:</strong>           17.12. - 18.12.14<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong>        Nice little town and starting point to surrounding islands; No beach nearby<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong>            Coron is a good place for wreck diving and island hopping trips. Better stay a few days if you are not in a hurry!</p>

<strong>Picture:</strong> Nice view to the bay from the rooftop</p>
<img src="/2015/03/Travel-Route-Philippines-Palawan/coron.jpg">  
<p><strong>Food:</strong>       <em>Lolo Nonoy’s Food Station</em> (4/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Restaurant<br>
Cheap and authentic Filipino food. Unfortunately the beer boat for Coron sunk at the last taifun a few days ago, thats why they only served apple flavored beer, bah.</p>
<p><font color="green">#### 4. Coron Town, Coron - El Nido, Palawan (5/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong>           Tour (<em>Sailing Paraw Expedition</em>)<br>
<strong>Tour Operator:</strong> <em><a href="http://www.taophilippines.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Tao Philippines</a></em> (5/5)<br>
<strong>Date:</strong>           18.12. - 22.12.14<br>
<strong>Distance:</strong>       220 km<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong>       5 days<br>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Sailing boat from Coron to East Tangat Wreck (Snorkeling), Luson Wreck<br>
(Snorkeling), Patsy Island (1. Night), Evergreen (Snorkeling), Galoc Island (Kayaking), Buluang Village on Culion (2. Night), Buko Island (Beach), Sharon Island (Snorkeling), Ginto Island (3. Night), Kala Kala Island (Beach), Tao Farm in north Palawan (4. Night), Cadlao Island (Lagoon), Helicopter Island (Snorkeling), El Nido<br>
<strong>Number of Passengers:</strong>   26<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> The Balatik is really spacious and the largest traditional Paraw Sailboat in the Philippines.</font></p>
<img src="/2015/03/Travel-Route-Philippines-Palawan/balatik.jpg">
<p><strong>Accommodation:</strong>  Single Beach huts or shared cottages on remote islands; The crew is setting up everything for the guests, including beddings, water and mosquito net<br>
<strong>Food:</strong>   Fresh fish on the way from fisherman villages, which will be cooked with vegetables and fruits coming from their own organic farms and on the boat. We had 4 days in a row of fresh seafood, which was very delicious, but we were really happy to enjoy an organic Lechon (roasted pork) at our last night at the Tao Farm.<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> Organic Lechon roasted for hours over open fire.</p>
<img src="/2015/03/Travel-Route-Philippines-Palawan/pig.jpg">   
<p><strong>Entertainment:</strong>  You have to buy your drinks (beer and rum) in advance at the Tao<br>
office. There is ice on board, so your beer is always cold. At night you will get served a sundowner (rum with pineapple juice) and the rest is up to you. On one night we stayed in a fisherman village with karaoke bar, which was a lot of fun.<br>
<strong>Activities:</strong>     Snorkeling at reefs and wrecks, relaxing, swimming, get-together, kayaking to lonely islands, massage<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> Lonely beaches at the Linapacan Group between Coron and Palawan with crystal clear water and wonderful nature over…</p>
<img src="/2015/03/Travel-Route-Philippines-Palawan/beach.jpg">  
... and underwater:
<img src="/2015/03/Travel-Route-Philippines-Palawan/snorkeling.jpg">  
<p><strong>Costs:</strong>          500 € including food, snorkel equipment &amp; accommodation<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> One of the best experiences we had in the Philippines. It is not cheap and not always comfortable, but it is totally worth it. You will visit empty islands, snorkel in untouched reefs and get in contact with local people. The paraw sailboat “Balatik” offers plenty of space and the crew is a cool bunch of locals. The founders of Tao have a really good concept to integrate local people in their business and operate an organic farm in one of their basecamps.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Even when your favorite trip dates are full, write them anyway, often there are still places available. Bring seasickness pills, wetbag, extra sunscreen and additional batteries, because there is mostly no electricity.</p>

<h4>5. El Nido, Palawan (4/5)</h4>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>           Town<br>
<strong>Date:</strong>           22.12. - 28.12.14<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Backpackers hot-spot with laid-back atmosphere; The local beach itself is not very pleasant as it is completely filled with concrete buildings, but the surrounding limestone islands of the Bacuit Archipelago with wonderful beaches are breathtaking; Better book in advance during high season. There is also an airport in El Nido itself, heading from and to Manila. You can only book flights via emailing the airlines (<em>Island Transvoyager</em> and <em>SeAir</em> ) or the _<a href="http://www.elnidoboutiqueandartcafe.com/TravelCenter.html" target="_blank" rel="external">El Nido Boutique &amp; Art Cafe</a>_.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> There is no ATM in El Nido, so bring enough pesos with you. Alternatively you can get cash advance at the El Nido Boutique &amp; Artcafe or try to get cash at the local petrol station with your credit card.<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> The nice town El Nido impresses more with its surrounding limestone cliffs then with its concrete beach.</p>
<img src="/2015/03/Travel-Route-Philippines-Palawan/el-nido.jpg">
<p><strong>Accommodation</strong>:  <em><a href="http://inngotouristinn.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Inngo Tourist Inn</a></em> (4/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> B&amp;B<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 33 € per night for AC-room with double bed and private bath<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Nice rooms with terrace and good breakfast; Free Wi-Fi, but connection is limited; Friendly staff &amp; owner</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Trattoria Atrove</em> (4/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Restaurant<br>
Great stone baked pizza for European prices; Often queue at the evening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="http://www.lasalangane.com" target="_blank" rel="external">La Salangane</a></em> (4/5)<br>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entertainment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pukka Bar</em> (4/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Restaurant, Bar &amp; Disco<br>
So called Reggae Bar, although the music is totally mixed. The best bar of El Nido is in the middle of the beach and packed at night</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Playground</em> (3/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Bar<br>
Bar in the back of El Nido with fireplace, table tennis, dramatic view on one of the big limestones, unfortunately with many mosquitos and without toilets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Island Hopping Tour A</em> (3/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Day tour<br>
<strong>Tour Operator:</strong> <em>Spider Booking</em><br>
<strong>Distance:</strong> 24 km<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 6 hours<br>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Boat (Outtrigger boat to Miniloc Island with big and small lagoon, Shimizu Island and Seven Commandos Beach)<br>
<strong>Number of passengers:</strong> 15<br>
<strong>Food:</strong> Water, fresh grilled fish, chicken and pork rice, vegetable and fruits included<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 22€<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> The tour is nice, but not as good as Tour C i would say. The biggest disadvantage is that all boats go to the same places at the same time so the lagoons and beaches are very crowded.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Bring proper water shoes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font color="green"><em>Private Island Hopping Tour C</em> (5/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Tour<br>
<strong>Tour Operator:</strong> <em><a href="https://midnightsunelnido.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Midnight Sun El Nido</a></em><br>
<strong>Distance:</strong>  44 km<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 6 hours<br>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Boat (Small outtrigger boat to Mantiloc Island with hidden beach &amp; secret beach, Tapiutan Island and Helicopter Island)<br>
<strong>Number of passengers:</strong> 4<br>
<strong>Food:</strong> Water, fresh grilled fish, chicken and pork, rice, vegetable and fruits included<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 24 € (95€ for 4 passengers)<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> We booked a private boat trip with Midnight Sun to choose the tour itinerary by our own. We had to walk 10 min to the Ca-alan Beach in the North of El Nido, where we started already at 8:00. This way we could enjoy the Hidden Beach all by our own and spend lunch at our private beach :)<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Bring proper water shoes and be aware that you can badly scratch yourself at Hidden and Secret Beach. We could recongize from peoples injuries, who did Tour C!<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> Waiting for the lunch at our private beach, which we only had to share with our adopted dog Herbert.</font></p>

<li><em><a href="http://www.submariner-diving.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Submariner Diving Center</a></em> (4/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Dive<br>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Boat (Big outtrigger boat)<br>
<strong>Food:</strong> Curry, rice, water, tea and coffee included<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 64 € for 3 dives<br>
<strong>Dive sites:</strong> West Entulala (2/5) Paglugaban Island (3/5) South Miniloc (5/5)<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> West Entulala is just a wall dive, the rest reef dives. South Miniloc is full of fish schools and beautiful corals. Don’t expect sharks or anything bigger then turtles in El Nido.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sightseeing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Las Cabanas</em> (3/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Beach<br>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Tricycle for 3 €<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Much nicer beach then in El Nido town. Unfortunately not much space and shadow.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nacpan Beach</em> (5/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Beach<br>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Tricycle or rented motorbike.<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 10 € for a scooter rental<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> It takes 45 min - 1 hour to get there. Drive north and after around 30 min you should find a tree with sign to Nacpan beach pointing to the left. Follow the bumpy sandtrack until the end.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Rent a dirt motorbike, not a scooter as some parts are off-road and make sure the light is working and you have the number of the rental company in case of a flat tire, which happened to us.<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> Nacpan Beach is a four km long stretch of white sand beach with a few food stall surrounded by palm trees.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. El Nido, Palawan - Puerto Princessa, Palawan (2/5)</h4>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>           Transportation<br>
<strong>Date:</strong>           28.12.14<br>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Van with AC<br>
<strong>Distance:</strong> 270 km<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 6 hours<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 9 €<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Drive during the day to see the landscape and passing by villages, otherwise the trip can become quite boring.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Ask the driver if he can drop you somewhere in Puerto Princessa and take a tricycle from there, otherwise he will drive every passenger to their hotel, which took us another hour. Better take the Bus anyway, because the van will become very full. Make sure that you don’t have to sit on one of the small emergency seats.</p>
<h4>7. Puerto Princessa, Palawan</h4>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>           City<br>
<strong>Date:</strong>       28.12. - 29.12.14<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Not a very special city, but the only place to fly from Palawan directly to the Visayas (middle part of the Philippines).<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> You can make a guided firefly tour to the mangroves (1 hour, 20 €), a trip to the underground river (1 day, 30€) or a dive safari (7 days, 1500 €) to the Tubbataha Reef, one of the top dive spots in the <a href="http://world.sw" target="_blank" rel="external">world.sw</a></p>
<p><strong>Accommodation:</strong> <em><a href="http://www.puertopension.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Puerto Pension</a></em> (4/5)<br>
<strong>Type:</strong> B&amp;B<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> 22€ per night AC-room with double bed and shared bath<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Nice wooden hotel with rooftop restaurant and courtyard with bar, who are dedicated to local nature conservation. Only the shared bathroom was a bit annoying, but they also offer rooms with private bath.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> You can book a tour to the Underground River.</p>

<strong>Cost for round trip:</strong>        655 € + 10 € Terminal Fee<br>
<strong>Distance:</strong>           11000 km</p>
<h4>Inbound Transportation: Frankfurt - Manila (3/5)</h4>
<p>15.12.14 / 14:05 - 06:15 +1     Frankfurt International - Beijing (CA 966)<br>
16.12.14 / 18:30 - 23:20    Beijing - Manila Ninoey Aquino (CA 629)<br>
07.01.15 / 06:40 - 11:20    Manila Ninoy Aquino - Beijing (CA 180)<br>
07.01.15 / 13:55 - 17:15    Beijing - Frankfurt International (CA 931)<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong>           26 hours<br>
<strong>Stopover:</strong>           12 hours (Beijing, China)<br>
<strong>Comment:</strong> Cheap flight, but not the best connection and departure time as you fly during the day and arrive in the middle of the night to  Beijing. Possibility to get a 72-hour Visa-free transit in Beijing; Visited the city center and the forbidden city. You can get cheap there by train and metro. Alternatively you can visit the Great Wall of China within a half day tour from the airport as well. When travelling in winter make sure you have warm clothes as Beijing can become very cold.<br>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Taxi trips from the airport can be really expensive, so better count and negotiate twice.<br>
<strong>Picture:</strong> Blue sky! and freezing cold (-7°C) at the Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City in Beijing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a first entry in this category I want to present you my upcoming travel to the Philippines. I planned the trip taking our last blog about <a href="http://blog.trackfellas.com/2014/12/how-to-plan-your-perfect-trip-in-10-steps/" target="_blank" rel="external">10 steps to plan your prefect trip</a> into account. Due to the high season during Christmas and New Years Eve in the Philippines I had to book nearly everything in advance.  As a result of the trip planning I want to show you the planned route and my itinerary.</p>
<h2>Travel Route</h2>
<p>To visualize my travel route I used Google Maps Engine. The tool allows to create and share maps online. Here is a screen shot of the travel route:</p>
<img src="/2014/12/a-trackfella-goes-philippines/Philippines-Trip-2014.jpg">
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The usability is quite poor as there is no possibility to create a connected route.</p>
<p>Also the result is not very pleasing as it does not show directions or any dates. At least it is possible to save your route online and share it with others. Here you find my map for my Philippines trip:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zrYZfx3FSo48.k0hvSW6HcMlg" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Maps Engine</a></p>
<p>Visualizing and planning travel routes is one of the key features we want to achieve with <a href="http://trackfellas.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Trackfellas</a>. We will give travellers the possibility to document their trips and share their routes and experiences with other individual travellers in the community.</p>
<h2>Itinerary</h2>
<p>I saved my itinerary into an excel file to maintain an overview. It is not really clearly arranged and of course it would make more sense to have it together with my travel route. Nevertheless no convincing travel planning platform exists so far. Until we can offer you an interface to save your itinerary and travel route in one place the current solution must suffice…</p>
<p>Here you see the preliminary itinerary witch highlights marked in bold:</p>
<img src="/2014/12/a-trackfella-goes-philippines/Itinerary-Philippines-Trip.jpg">
<p>Planning this trip took me around 3 months, so now it is time to reap the tropical fruits of this work.</p>
<p>I will let you know, how it worked out!</p>
<p>See you soon from the other side of the planet,</p>
<p>Moritz from Trackfellas</p>
